        <h1>Privacy Policy for Rony AI Facebook App</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 23, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the <strong>Rony AI Facebook App</strong> (“the App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information when it automatically creates and publishes content to the <strong>Rony</strong> Facebook Page using AI.</p>

        <p>By using the App in connection with Facebook, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>The Rony AI Facebook App is a tool used to automatically generate and publish posts (text and images) to the <strong>Rony</strong> Facebook Page using AI services such as OpenAI or Microsoft Copilot.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Page name:</strong> Rony</li>
            <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Facebook Page</li>
            <li><strong>Contact:</strong> your-email@example.com</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App itself does <strong>not</strong> directly collect personal information from you outside of what is provided by Facebook or our AI providers.</p>
        <p>Depending on how Facebook and AI services work, we may have access to:</p>
        <ol>

                    <li>Basic engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares, reach) as provided by Facebook</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is used only to operate and improve automated posting.</p>

        </ol>

            <li><strong>Legal reasons:</strong> if required by law, regulation, legal process, or government request and only to the minimum extent necessary</li>

        <p>We do not intentionally retain or store personal data of individual Facebook users beyond what is automatically stored by Facebook or our hosting/platform tools.</p>
        <p>We keep data only for as long as necessary to operate the App and comply with legal obligations.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect the data processed by the App, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using secure connections (HTTPS) where possible</li>

        </ul>
        <p>However, no system can be 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The Rony AI Facebook App and the Rony Page are <strong>not</strong> directed to children under 13 (or under the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in functionality, legal requirements, or best practices.</p>
        <p>When we update the policy, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top. Continued use of the App or the Rony Facebook Page after changes are posted means you accept those changes.</p>
